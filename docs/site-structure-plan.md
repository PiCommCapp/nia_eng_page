# Site Structure Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements the site structure defined in `pages.md` as a functional web application, creating a hierarchical navigation system that matches the Mermaid flow diagram and organizes all engineering systems by committee room and role.

## Creative Phase Summary ✅ COMPLETED

**Architecture Decisions Made:**

- **Navigation Approach**: Multi-page with separate HTML files for each page
- **Navigation Flow**: Step-by-step (Index → Committees → Room → Role)
- **Role Selection**: Large, color-coded buttons with icons for quick recognition
- **Data Source**: Use `pages.md` as primary source, abandon `bookmarks.md`
- **Content Strategy**: Manual HTML creation for simplicity and speed
- **Visual Design**: Category-based color coding, desktop-optimized layout
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb navigation with clickable path elements

**Key Design Principles:**

- Functionality over aesthetics
- Quick access in critical situations
- Large, clearly marked buttons
- Color coding for quick visual identification
- Desktop/engineering workstation optimization

## Site Structure Analysis

Based on `pages.md`, the site follows this hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    1[Index] --> 2[Plenary]
    1 --> 4[Engineering]
    1 --> 3[Committees]
    1 --> 17[CR Engineering]

    2 --> 18[Plenary Operator]
    2 --> 19[Plenary Engineer]

    3 --> 5[CR21]
    3 --> 6[CR29]
    3 --> 7[CR30]
    3 --> 8[Senate]

    5 --> 9[CR21 Operator]
    5 --> 10[CR21 Engineer]
    6 --> 11[CR29 Operator]
    6 --> 12[CR29 Engineer]
    7 --> 13[CR30 Operator]
    7 --> 14[CR30 Engineer]
    8 --> 15[Senate Operator]
    8 --> 16[Senate Engineer]
```

## Implementation Strategy

- Design desktop-optimized navigation (no mobile needed)

### Phase 2: Page Implementation

**2.1 Index Page**

- Main landing page with navigation to all sections
- Quick access to most frequently used systems
- Search functionality
- Status indicators for critical systems

**2.2 Plenary Section**

- Plenary main page with links to Operator/Engineer roles
- Plenary Operator page with camera controls and essential links
- Plenary Engineer page with full system access including spotter cameras

**2.3 Committees Section**

- Committee room selection interface
- Individual pages for CR21, CR29, CR30, Senate
- Each room page with Operator/Engineer role selection

**2.4 Role-Based Pages**

- Operator pages: Essential links, camera controls, basic systems
- Engineer pages: Full system access, advanced controls, diagnostic tools
- Consistent layout across all committee rooms

**2.5 Engineering Section**

- General engineering tools and documentation
- KVM switch access
- Network infrastructure management
- Support systems and documentation

### Phase 3: Content Integration

**3.1 Bookmark Mapping**

- Map existing bookmarks to appropriate committee room pages
- Categorize systems by function and priority
- Create role-specific filtered views
- Maintain search functionality within new structure

**3.2 System Organization**

- Group systems by committee room (CR21, CR29, CR30, Senate)
- Organize by role (Operator vs Engineer)
- Prioritize critical systems for quick access
- Add visual indicators for system types

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement

**4.1 Responsive Design**

- Mobile-first approach for all pages
- Touch-friendly navigation for tablets
- Desktop optimization for engineering workstations
- Consistent experience across devices

**4.2 Performance Optimization**

- Lazy loading for page content
- Efficient data caching
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Fast page transitions

**4.3 Accessibility**

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Clear visual hierarchy
