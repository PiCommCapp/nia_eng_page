#### Recent Fixes (December 2024)

- **Configuration Dialog Issue**: Fixed the "Configure" menu option that wasn't working by replacing tkinter-based dialog with web-based configuration page
- **Cross-Platform Makefile**: Updated makefile commands to work on both Windows and Unix/Linux/macOS systems
- **GUI Compatibility**: Replaced tkinter dependency with web-based configuration to avoid platform-specific GUI issues
- **Windows Support**: Added Windows-specific commands for kill, clean, status, and install operations
- **Terminal-Free Configuration**: Eliminated the need for terminal interaction when using the configuration dialog - users can now configure the app entirely through the web interface
- **Icon Color Fix**: Fixed the tray icon color issue - the icon now properly shows green when the server is running instead of gray
- **Configuration Dialog CORS Fix**: Fixed the "failed to fetch" error in the configuration dialog by adding proper CORS headers and improving server lifecycle management
- **Configuration Dialog Variable Scope Fix**: Fixed the NameError in the HTTP server handler by properly capturing variables in the closure scope
- **Configuration Pages Fix**: Updated available pages in configuration to only include pages that actually exist, removing invalid references to non-existent index.html files
- **Testing and Validation Framework**: Implemented comprehensive testing suite with unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and accessibility tests
- **CSS Formatting Fix**: Fixed malformed CSS links in all HTML pages (except index.html) that were causing formatting issues, restoring proper styling across the entire portal
- **CSS Loading Optimization**: Simplified CSS loading mechanism for all pages to use reliable, straightforward stylesheet links instead of complex preload mechanisms that were causing styling issues
- **Deployment Packaging and GitHub Actions**: Implemented comprehensive deployment system with version management, automated builds, and GitHub Actions workflows for releases
- **Version Management System**: Created automated version bumping, release packaging, and cross-platform build system with manual and automated triggers

#### Reflection Highlights

- **What Went Well**: Modular architecture, creative phase decisions, UV integration, build system, user experience design
- **Challenges**: PyInstaller configuration, circular dependencies, cross-platform testing, feature creep prevention, tkinter compatibility
- **Lessons Learned**: Memory bank effectiveness, incremental development, documentation-first approach, simplicity over features, web-based solutions for cross-platform compatibility
- **Next Steps**: User testing, performance optimization, icon customization, advanced configuration options
