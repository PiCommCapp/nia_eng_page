# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
We have implemented the core functionality for the NIA Engineering Page project:

1. Memory Bank structure is fully set up and populated
2. Basic development environment is configured
3. Functional index.html with responsive design is created
4. Bookmarks parser successfully extracts system links
5. Search functionality allows quick access to systems
6. Systems are organized by categories and subcategories

The next focus is on refinement and optimization:

1. Add offline capability for emergency situations
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
3. Optimize performance for instant loading
4. Add basic system status indicators (static version)
5. Test across multiple browsers and devices

## Current Phase
**Phase 1**: Static HTML interface with local deployment

## Key Resources
- `index.html`: Main interface (functional version created)
- `js/bookmarks-parser.js`: Parser for bookmarks.html
- `bookmarks.html`: Source data containing all system links
- `compose.yml`: Docker configuration for future n8n integration
- `.env`: Environment configuration for development

## Current Requirements
1. Enhance the existing interface with:
   - Offline capability via service workers
   - Keyboard shortcuts for navigation and search
   - Faster loading through optimization techniques
   - Basic status indicators for critical systems

2. Improve usability:
   - Responsive design refinements for mobile devices
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Better visual hierarchy for nested categories

3. Prepare for testing:
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Performance testing
   - Usability testing with engineers
   - Documentation for users

## Next Steps
1. Implement service worker for offline capability
2. Add keyboard shortcut functionality
3. Optimize assets for faster loading
4. Implement basic status indicators
5. Test in multiple browsers and devices
6. Create user documentation

## Open Questions
1. What keyboard shortcuts would be most useful to engineers?
2. Should we add any systems not currently in the bookmarks?
3. What specific offline capabilities are most important?
4. Should we include any static status indicators in Phase 1?
5. Are there any additional categories that should be added?

## Immediate Tasks
- Create service worker for offline capability
- Implement keyboard shortcuts
- Test interface in multiple browsers
- Add basic system status indicators
- Create user documentation
