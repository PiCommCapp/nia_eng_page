# NIA Engineering Portal - Implementation Plan

## Project Goals

1. Create a lightning-fast interface for accessing engineering systems
2. Organize systems logically for intuitive navigation
3. Ensure offline reliability during network issues
4. Minimize dependencies and maintenance overhead
5. Enable Phase 2 automation features without compromising Phase 1 simplicity

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

#### 1. Environment Setup

- [x] Set up VSCode environment with workspace settings
- [x] Configure recommended extensions
- [ ] Establish development workflow and branching strategy
- [ ] Create .editorconfig for cross-editor consistency

#### 2. Content Organization

- [ ] Convert bookmarks.html to markdown format for easier editing
- [ ] Analyze and document system categories
- [ ] Develop categorization taxonomy
- [ ] Create category-to-system mapping document

#### 3. Interface Design

- [ ] Create wireframes for desktop layout
- [ ] Design component system (minimal CSS variables)
- [ ] Develop style guide for consistency

#### 4. Core HTML/CSS Implementation

- [ ] Create semantic HTML structure with accessibility in mind
- [ ] Implement responsive CSS using mobile-first approach
- [ ] Design navigation components
- [ ] Implement system card components

#### 5. JavaScript Functionality

- [ ] Refine bookmarks parser for optimal performance
- [ ] Implement search functionality with highlighting
- [ ] Create category filtering
- [ ] Add minimal keyboard navigation (focus on search)

#### 6. Offline Capability

- [ ] Implement service worker for essential file caching
- [ ] Add online/offline status indicator
- [ ] Test offline functionality in various scenarios

#### 7. Testing and Optimization

- [ ] Test in target browsers
- [ ] Optimize performance (first contentful paint)
- [ ] Validate HTML for accessibility
- [ ] Test with screen readers

#### 8. Documentation

- [ ] Create user guide for engineers
- [ ] Document update process for administrators
- [ ] Create technical documentation for future development

### Phase 2: Automation (Future)

#### 1. n8n Setup

- [ ] Configure Docker environment for n8n
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Establish connection security

#### 2. Workflow Development

- [ ] Create system health check workflows
- [ ] Implement status monitoring
- [ ] Develop command execution framework

## Development Standards

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Include ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Minimize nesting depth

### CSS

- Use BEM naming convention
- Implement CSS variables for theming
- Keep selectors simple (max 3 levels)
- Mobile-first responsive design

### JavaScript

- Vanilla JS only (no frameworks)
- Use modern ES6+ features with appropriate fallbacks
- Implement error handling with graceful degradation
- Comment complex logic

### Performance

- Inline critical CSS
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Optimize asset loading
- Implement efficient DOM manipulation

## Timeline

| Week | Focus Area             | Deliverables                    |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1    | Environment & Content  | VSCode setup, Bookmark analysis |
| 2    | Design & Planning      | Wireframes, Component design    |
| 3    | Core Implementation    | HTML structure, CSS framework   |
| 4    | JavaScript & Features  | Parser, Search, Filtering       |
| 5    | Testing & Refinement   | Browser testing, Optimization   |
| 6    | Documentation & Launch | User guides, Technical docs     |

## Success Criteria

1. Interface loads in < 2 seconds on target devices
2. All systems accessible within 3 clicks/taps
3. Works offline after initial load
4. Passes WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements
5. Engineers can find any system in < 10 seconds

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Complete VSCode environment setup
2. Convert bookmarks.html to markdown format
3. Begin wireframing the interface
4. Document system categorization approach
