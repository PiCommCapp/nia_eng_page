# Product Context

## Core Purpose
The NIA Engineering Page serves as a critical access point for broadcast engineers who need immediate access to infrastructure systems during live operations. When systems fail or need adjustment, every second counts. This portal ensures that engineers can access any required system with minimal clicks and zero delay.

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Live Broadcast Emergency
During a live broadcast, a gallery monitor displays a "No Signal" error. The engineer needs to:
1. Check the SDI router status
2. Verify KVM connection to affected system
3. Access PDU to power cycle equipment if necessary
4. Access backup systems if primary fails

Without the engineering page, this could take several minutes of navigation through bookmarks, remembering IPs, or consulting documentation. With the engineering page, all required systems are accessible within seconds.

### Scenario 2: Pre-Event Configuration
Before a major broadcast event, engineers need to:
1. Verify all critical systems are online
2. Configure backup routes
3. Ensure redundant systems are in standby
4. Test all gallery displays and control interfaces

The engineering page facilitates this process by grouping related systems together and providing quick access to each component.

### Scenario 3: Remote Support
When on-call engineers are contacted about issues:
1. They need immediate access to systems from their laptops
2. May need to execute common remediation tasks
3. Must verify system status quickly
4. May need to escalate to physical intervention

Phase 2 n8n integration will allow common support tasks to be automated and executed with a single click.

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Time to Access**: How quickly can an engineer access a specific system? (Target: < 3 seconds)
- **Completeness**: What percentage of required systems are accessible? (Target: 100%)
- **Reliability**: Is the portal always available when needed? (Target: 100%)

### Secondary Metrics
- **Usability**: Can new engineers navigate without training? (Target: Yes)
- **Maintenance**: How much effort is required to keep the portal updated? (Target: < 1 hour/month)
- **Automation**: How many routine tasks are automated? (Phase 2 metric)

## Stakeholders

### Primary
- Broadcast engineers
- Technical operations staff
- On-call support staff

### Secondary
- IT support team
- Broadcast management
- Production staff (indirect users)

## Constraints

### Technical
- Must work offline/locally
- Must function during network degradation
- No external dependencies
- Minimal resource usage

### Operational
- Must be easily updateable by non-developers
- Changes must be quickly deployable to all workstations
- Must accommodate rapid evolution of infrastructure
