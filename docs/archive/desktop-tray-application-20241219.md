## Implementation

### Approach

Implemented a modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns, following the creative phase design decisions. The approach prioritized simplicity, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility while ensuring seamless integration with the existing project structure.

### Key Components

#### 1. Tray Application (`tray_app.py`)

- **System Tray Icon**: Material Design "www" icon with color-coded status indication
  - Green: Server running
  - Red: Server stopped
  - Gray: Server error
- **Context Menu**: Start/Stop server, Configure, Open Portal, Exit
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status indication via callbacks
- **Process Management**: Background monitoring of server process

#### 2. Configuration Manager (`config_manager.py`)

- **Persistence**: Automatic saving and loading of configuration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of configuration errors

#### 3. Server Controller (`server_controller.py`)

- **Process Management**: Start/stop server using subprocess
- **Port Conflict Handling**: Automatic port detection and user choice
- **Integration**: Uses existing `scripts/serve.py` with UV
- **Monitoring**: Background thread monitoring server process
- **Browser Integration**: Open portal in default browser

#### 4. GUI Components (`gui_components.py`)

- **Configuration Dialog**: Simple tkinter dialog for settings
- **Port Input**: Validated port number input with test functionality
- **Page Selection**: Dropdown with available page options
- **Validation**: Input validation with user feedback

#### 5. Build System

- **PyInstaller Configuration**: Cross-platform executable generation
- **Build Scripts**: Automated build process with UV integration
- **Makefile Integration**: Seamless integration with existing build system
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic platform-specific building
