## Lessons Learned

### Project Management

- **Memory Bank System Effectiveness**: The isolation-focused memory bank system with visual process maps significantly improved task tracking and documentation quality
- **Creative Phase Value**: Dedicated creative phase documentation prevented scope creep and ensured architectural decisions were well-documented
- **Task Granularity**: Breaking large tasks into smaller, specific subtasks improved progress tracking and completion rates
- **Documentation-First Approach**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout development facilitated knowledge transfer and future maintenance

### Technical Architecture

- **Offline-First Design**: Prioritizing offline functionality from the beginning resulted in a more robust, reliable application
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Multi-level navigation requires careful UX design but provides excellent scalability and organization
- **Single Source of Truth**: Using `pages.md` as the primary data source simplified content management and reduced duplication
- **Performance vs Features**: Balancing minimal JavaScript with required functionality resulted in optimal performance

### Content Strategy

- **Role-Based Organization**: Separating content by user role (Operator/Engineer) significantly improved usability and reduced cognitive load
- **Visual Differentiation**: Color coding and consistent styling patterns improved navigation efficiency
- **Committee Room Structure**: Organizing systems by physical location (committee rooms) aligned with user mental models
- **Engineering Sub-System Organization**: Breaking engineering systems into logical sub-pages improved discoverability

### Development Process

- **Incremental Implementation**: Implementing features incrementally and testing frequently prevented integration issues
- **File Organization**: Clear directory structure and naming conventions improved maintainability
- **Development Tools**: Effective makefile and scripts significantly improved development efficiency
- **Testing Strategy**: Regular testing of navigation flows and offline functionality caught issues early
