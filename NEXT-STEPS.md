# NIA Engineering Portal - Progress Summary and Next Steps

## Accomplishments

We've made significant progress on the NIA Engineering Portal project:

### Environment Setup

- ✅ Created VSCode configuration files (settings.json, extensions.json)
- ✅ Set up .editorconfig for consistent formatting
- ✅ Created package.json with development dependencies
- ✅ Set up Memory Bank structure for documentation

### Planning and Documentation

- ✅ Created detailed implementation plan
- ✅ Documented wireframes for desktop and mobile
- ✅ Established design system with color scheme and typography
- ✅ Documented environment setup instructions
- ✅ Created bookmark conversion plan and script

### Core Implementation

- ✅ Created basic HTML structure
- ✅ Implemented responsive CSS layout
- ✅ Designed navigation components
- ✅ Implemented JavaScript parser for bookmarks
- ✅ Created search functionality
- ✅ Implemented service worker for offline capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Run the Bookmark Conversion Script**

   - Test the script on existing bookmarks.html
   - Review the generated markdown
   - Make adjustments to the script if needed

2. **Create System Categorization Document**

   - Analyze the bookmark structure
   - Document the logical organization of systems
   - Define category taxonomy

3. **Refine UI Components**
   - Update HTML/CSS based on wireframes
   - Implement consistent component styling
   - Enhance accessibility features

### Short Term (Next Week)

1. **Testing and Validation**

   - Test in target browsers
   - Validate HTML for accessibility
   - Verify all links are working
   - Test offline functionality

2. **Create User Documentation**

   - Write user guide for engineers
   - Document update/maintenance process
   - Create technical documentation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize CSS and JavaScript
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Improve first contentful paint

### Long Term (Next Month)

1. **Phase 2 Planning**
   - Define automation requirements
   - Design n8n workflow architecture
   - Document system dependencies
   - Create security guidelines

## Development Workflow

1. **Make changes locally** using VSCode with our configured extensions
2. **Test changes** using the built-in Live Server
3. **Update documentation** in the Memory Bank
4. **Mark completed tasks** in tasks.md
5. **Commit changes** with descriptive commit messages

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <repository-url>
cd nia_eng_page

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bookmark conversion script
npm run convert

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the preferred categorization for systems?
2. Are there any systems not in the bookmarks that should be added?
3. What keyboard shortcuts would be most useful for engineers?
4. What specific offline capabilities are most important?

Let's continue our methodical approach to ensure we deliver a high-quality,
fast, and intuitive engineering portal that meets the critical needs of the team.
