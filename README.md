# NIA Engineering Page

A simple landing page for use on engineering computers

Pages will be dirived from the bookmarks.html file

Speed and simplicity are key!! 

Frontend HTML launched as a local file

Backend is a n8n instance. Hope is we can accomidate webhooks while keeping the front end simple to throw n8n workflows. Nothing terribly complicated. I dont want to run a web server or anything else. n8n will run on only one PC, all others are simple pages, so we need to be able to activate webhooks on a local network, and a simple, SIMPLE way to define them.
